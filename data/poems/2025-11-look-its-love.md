I wondered what love looks like  
Isn't it sunset or sunrise?  
I had never seen it, 'cause I was blind,  
But now I see - brightly - looking at You,   
My God, my Saviour, my Lord Most High.  

I see You in a mother carrying her child,   
And in a father lessoning his.  

I see You in my brothers and sisters in Christ,  
When they join together in worship and pray.  
I see You deep in their joyful eyes.  

I see you in the morning, evening and night,  
When I wake up or lie down on my bed.  

I see You down under the ocean deep,  
Up beyond the mountain high,  
All around the earth, right upon the sky.  

You are all the Love in our lives.
